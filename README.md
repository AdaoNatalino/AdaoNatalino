Hello, I'm Adao Natalino! ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineer who loves figuring things out. Solving logical problems was always a great activity (also because of my mechanical engineering background), which has led me down the path of full stack development, where I get to do that everyday.

My Pinned repos are the projects I built during my journey at Flatiron School, studying their Software Engineer course.

Hit me up for any questions, suggestions or projects!
